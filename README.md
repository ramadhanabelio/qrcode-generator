# QR Code Generator | Responsive Web for Generate QR Code with Tailwind.css & Flask (Python Framework)

## Description
This is one of the projects I created to enhance my knowledge of the Python programming language. This project involves creating a responsive web application for mobile devices. The web application serves as a tool for generating QR codes automatically using Python's built-in libraries. I developed this web application using the Python programming language with the Flask framework to enable the presentation of Python projects in a web interface.
